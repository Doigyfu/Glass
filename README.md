This repo is a rewritten fork of https://github.com/Armored-Dragon/pymineserver

Puremine also have basic plugin support: you need to create a directory
in plugins folder, and then, create how many files do you want:

anynameofscript.py
anotherscript.py

You can check the example plugin to see what you need to put in this files :)

Plugin system originally taken from https://github.com/zeuxisoo/python-pluginplot and heavily modified
