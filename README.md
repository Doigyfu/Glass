Puremine: Minecraft Modern server in Python - under heavy development

To install libraries just type:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Supports only *Python 2.7* and ***PyPy***, Python 3 support is planned.

Start start.py (in server folder) to run. To change config - edit server.properties in server folder

Puremine also have basic plugin support: you need to create a directory in plugins folder, and then, create how many files do you want: anynameofscript.py anotherscript.py

You can check the example plugin located in plugins/Example/plugin.py

This repo is a rewritten fork of https://github.com/Armored-Dragon/pymineserver.
Plugin system originally taken from https://github.com/zeuxisoo/python-pluginplot and heavily modified.
